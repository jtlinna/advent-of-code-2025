## Day 1: Secret Entrance
[Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2025/day/1) involves solving a password based on a list of left/right rotations of a dial. The dial always starts at 50, and the input is a list of rotations in the format of direction (L/R) followed by how many steps the dial is rotated. For part 1 we want to solve how many times the dial is at 0 after a rotation from the input list, and for part 2 we want to solve how many times the dial is at 0 after a single step in a rotation from the input list.
